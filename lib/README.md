This subdirectory contains the CUP (version 0.11b) and jflex (version
1.7.0) tools used to process the scanner and parser specifications.
In addition, there are some emacs and vi configuration files taken
from the jflex distribution that you might find useful when editing
grammar specifications.

It also contains copies of the `symbol` and `lr_parser` source files,
pulled from the CUP source repository.  These may be useful for
reference.  Parsers generated by CUP extend `lr_parser`, and it is
possible to override methods in the CUP specification.  That is
sometimes useful for error handling and similar customizations (see
the CUP documentation for detail).  symbol and its subclasses define
the tokens.

Finally, this directory contains the necessary libraries for running JUnit
tests, to make it easy for you to write your own tests as you develop
your compiler.

You should not attempt to compile these files (compiled versions are
included in the jar files where needed), and the source versions might
not correspond exactly to the compiled versions.  But they should give
a good idea of the interfaces and operation of these classes if that
is helpful.

Otherwise there is no need to look inside this directory or change
anything in it.
